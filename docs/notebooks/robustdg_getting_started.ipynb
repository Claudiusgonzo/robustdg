    "Domain Generalization (DG) is the task of learning a predictive model that can generalize to different data distributions. Intuitively, models trained by just aggregating the data from different domain might overfit to the domains observed during training. Many DG methods have been proposed to improve the generalization of models for OOD data.\n",

For example, the model would be shown data containing rotations between 15 to 75 degrees during training; while at the test time it has to classify digits rotated by 90 degrees. Hence, different rotations/domains lead to a difference between the train and the test distributions\n",
