    "Rotated MNIST consists of various data domains, each corresponding to a specific rotation. It provides a very easy way to genereate out of distribution (OOD) data samples. For example, the model would be shown data containing rotations between 15 to 75 degrees during training; while at the test time it has to classify digits rotated by 90 degrees. Hence, different rotations/domains lead to a difference between the train and the test distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of learning model that generalize to different data distributions at the test time is studied under Domain Generalization (DG). Intuitively, models trained by just aggregating the data from different domain might overfit to the domains that you observe during training. Many DG methods have been proposed to improve the generalization of models for OOD data. \n",
